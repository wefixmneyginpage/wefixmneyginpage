When you take out a flex loan, you can access a line of credit. You can borrow against that line of credit and repay what you borrow with interest.

With an open line of credit, you can continue to borrow up to your credit limit as needed. In most cases, you can pay more than your required minimum monthly payment without any penalties to pay the debt off faster.

A flex loan is usually an unsecured line of credit, which means you do not have to put up one of your assets, such as your car, for collateral. While you do not risk losing an asset, the lender assumes more risk if you do not repay what you borrow. As a result, flex loans typically come with higher annual percentage rates (APRs).
