Minimal credit history requirements. Lenders offer some types of loans only to people with an established credit history and relatively high credit scores. Flex loans are often available to people with little credit history or poor credit scores. Often, lenders will not check your credit before offering a flex loan.
Quick application process. You can often apply for and receive a flex loan within a short period of time, potentially even the same day.
Fast funding. Once you are approved for a flex loan, you have access to the funds up to your credit limit.
Flexibility. Some loans have a fixed term, meaning you have a set period in which to repay what you borrow. As it is an open line of credit, you only need to make your minimum monthly payments on a flex loan. There is no set deadline for full repayment.
