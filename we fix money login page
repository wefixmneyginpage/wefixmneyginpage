A flex loan can be a good option in certain situations. If you have inconsistent income, a flex loan can help you cover your expenses while you wait to get paid. If you need help covering an unexpected expense, a flex loan can also help. This option may be particularly attractive to people who wouldn't quality for other kinds of loans due to poor credit.

Before you decide to get a flex loan, consider your ability to repay it. Will you be able to do so in a relatively short period of time, or will you need to keep borrowing against the line of credit? It is possible that continued borrowing and making only the minimum payments could lead to a significant amount of debt.
